README for Java API Caller
Overview
This Java application sends an HTTP POST request to an external API, passing a user-provided prompt, and retrieves the response. The application uses the HttpURLConnection class to make an API call and handles possible error scenarios like invalid API keys, incorrect URLs, and rate-limiting responses.
Features
* Accepts user input (a prompt) from the console.
* Sends the input as a request to a specified API endpoint.
* Handles API authentication using Bearer Token.
* Processes the response and extracts the relevant content.
* Provides error handling for common issues such as invalid API keys, request limits, or incorrect URLs.
Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
* Internet connection to make API calls.
* An API key from the provider of the API.
* URL of the API endpoint.
* Model specification for the API (if applicable).
How to Use
* Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) or a text editor.
* Replace the following placeholders in the callAPI() method with your actual details:
* URL PROVIDER: The URL endpoint of the API.
* YOUR API HERE: Your API key for authentication.
* THE SPECIFIC MODEL HERE: The model you are interacting with on the API (if applicable).
* Compile and run the program.
When prompted, enter your text prompt, and the program will send it to the API and display the response.
